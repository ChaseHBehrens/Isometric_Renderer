# Isometric Renderer
A rendering system that displays 3d graphics using only 2d assets. Originally programmed in 2022 hence the poor code quality.

# Controles
- QAWSED to move
- space to place and delete blocks
- RF to rotate camera
- esc to close
# Unsolved issues
The challenge is to only render blocks in direct view of the camera. I haven't come up with a good solution for this yet. Thus when the camera position is within a block everything will disappear in the player view. 
# Future plans
I am working on a voxel sprite stacking editor and rendering system in rust. This will allow for more dynamic camera movement while maintaining the unique aesthetic of the isometric perspective.
